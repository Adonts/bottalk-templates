## [Tip of the Day](https://github.com/bottalk-io/templates/tree/master/tip-of-the-day)
This template allows you to build Alexa Skills / Google Action with the daily information.
Every day of the week users can learn something new from your Skill / Action: deals, news, currency rates etc.
It's very easy to customize: every day of the week has it's own step.
Just edit the content of the ***sendText*** and/or ***sendCard*** action - and you are ready to go!

```yaml
- name: Monday Step
  actions:
    - sendText: >
          This is the placeholder for any text you want to send on Monday.
    - sendCard:
        title: 'Monday Card'
        text: >
          You can also send the cards of course
