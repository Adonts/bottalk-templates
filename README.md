## [Tip of the Day](https://github.com/bottalk/templates/tree/master/tip-of-the-day)
This template allows you to build Alexa Skills / Google Action with the daily information.
Every day of the week users can learn something new from your Skill / Action: deals, news, currency rates etc.
It's very easy to customize: every day of the week has it's own step.
Just edit the content of the ***sendText*** and/or ***sendCard*** action - and you are ready to go!

```yaml
- name: Monday Step
  actions:
    - sendText: >
          This is the placeholder for any text you want to send on Monday.
    - sendCard:
        title: 'Monday Card'
        text: >
          You can also send the cards of course

## [House Guest]((https://github.com/bottalk/templates/tree/master/house-guest))

Are you an Airbnb host? Or are your friends or relatives just staying over? In any case - use can create and publish (!) this scenario as an Alexa Skill / Google Action to help your guests feel just like at home.

Dialogue example:

> Alexa, open House Guest

> **Alexa**: Welcome to our home! Are you looking for something? Just ask! For example:
            "Where is TV remote?" or
            "How do I lock the door?" or
            "What is the number of the host?"

> What is the WiFi password?

> **Alexa**: The WiFi password is AF340i_4v

> How do I turn on the air conditioner?

> **Alexa**:  To turn on the air conditioner just use the remote on the wall.


How to customize the scenario?

1. Edit the ```slots.yml``` file in order to add things your guests might want to find or do:

```
thing_to_find:
  - 'TV remote'
  - 'WiFi password'
thing_to_do:
  - 'lock the door'
  - 'turn on the air conditioner'
```

2. Edit the ```intetns.yml``` file and come up with the variations of how your guests could ask Alexa / Google Home for instructions:

```
where_is:
  - 'Where is the {thing_to_find}'
how_do_i:
  - 'How do I {thing_to_do}'
contact:
  - 'Contact'
  - 'Contact information of the host'
  - 'Call the host'
  - 'What is the number of the host'
```

3. Edit the ```main.yml``` file to provide the answers to the guests' requests. For instance, that's how "How do I..." step looks like:

```
- name: How Do I Step
  actions:
    - sendText: >
        {% if thing_to_do == 'lock the door' %}
          You can lock the door with the digital key, using your mobile phone.
          Yes, we're very forward-thinking house.
        {% elseif thing_to_do == 'turn on the air conditioner' %}
          To turn on the air conditioner just use the remote on the well.
        {% endif %}
    - sendText: >
        Is there anything else I can do for you?
    - getInput:
  next:
    where_is: Where Is Step
    how_do_i: How Do I Step
    contact: Contact Step
```
