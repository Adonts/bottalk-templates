This template allows you to build Alexa Skills / Google Action with the daily information.
Every day of the week users can learn something new from your Skill / Action: deals, news, currency rates etc.
It's very easy to customize: every day of the week has it's own step.
Just edit the content of the ***sendText*** and/or ***sendCard*** action - and you are ready to go!

```yaml
- name: Monday Step
  actions:
    - sendText: >
          This is the placeholder for any text you want to send on Monday.

## [House Guest](https://github.com/bottalk/templates/tree/master/house-guest)

Are you an Airbnb host? Or are your friends or relatives just staying over? In any case - use can create and publish (!) this scenario as an Alexa Skill / Google Action to help your guests feel just like at home.

Dialogue example:

> Alexa, open House Guest

> **Alexa**: Welcome to our home! Are you looking for something? Just ask! For example:
            "Where is TV remote?" or
            "How do I lock the door?" or
            "What is the number of the host?"

> What is the WiFi password?

> **Alexa**: The WiFi password is AF340i_4v

> How do I turn on the air conditioner?

> **Alexa**:  To turn on the air conditioner just use the remote on the wall.


How to customize the scenario?

1. Edit the ```slots.yml``` file in order to add things your guests might want to find or do:

```yaml
thing_to_find:
  - 'TV remote'
  - 'WiFi password'
thing_to_do:
  - 'lock the door'
  - 'turn on the air conditioner'
```

2. Edit the ```intetns.yml``` file and come up with the variations of how your guests could ask Alexa / Google Home for instructions:

```yaml
where_is:
  - 'Where is the {thing_to_find}'
how_do_i:
  - 'How do I {thing_to_do}'
contact:
  - 'Contact'
  - 'Contact information of the host'
  - 'Call the host'
  - 'What is the number of the host'
```

3. Edit the ```main.yml``` file to provide the answers to the guests' requests. For instance, that's how "How do I..." step looks like:

```yaml
- name: How Do I Step
  actions:
    - sendText: >
        {% if thing_to_do == 'lock the door' %}
          You can lock the door with the digital key, using your mobile phone.
          Yes, we're very forward-thinking house.
        {% elseif thing_to_do == 'turn on the air conditioner' %}
          To turn on the air conditioner just use the remote on the well.
        {% endif %}
    - sendText: >
        Is there anything else I can do for you?
    - getInput:
  next:
    where_is: Where Is Step
    how_do_i: How Do I Step
    contact: Contact Step
```

## [Trivia Game](https://github.com/bottalk/templates/tree/master/trivia-game)

With this template you can build any kind of trivia game you like. In this example we play the movies trivia.

Dialogue example:

> Alexa, open Trivia Template

> **Alexa**: [Audio Effect]
            Welcome to the most insightful movies trivia game in the whole wide world!
            Do you want to start a game?

> Yes, sure

> **Alexa**: Round One! Movie Quotes!
             I give you the quote, you give me movie it came from.
             The quote: [Pause]  ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt handle the truth!‚Äù
             Which movie is this?
             A League of Their Own
             The Sixth Sense
             or
             A Few Good Men?

> A Few Good Men

> **Alexa**:  [Audio Effect]
            That's correct!
            Your current score is 1 point.
            Are you ready for the second round?

### How to create your own trivia game?

1. To customize the game start with editing the **First Question** step in the main.yml file:

```yaml
- name: First Question
  actions:
    - sendCard:
        title: BotTalk Trivia Template
        text: >
            Which movie is the quote "You can‚Äôt handle the truth!" from? {{ '\n\n' | raw }}

            - A League of Their Own {{ '\n' | raw }}
            - The Sixth Sense {{ '\n' | raw }}
            - A Few Good Men? {{ '\n' | raw }}
        image: 'https://bottalk.de/img/bottalk_landing_logo.png'
    - sendText: >
        Round One! Movie Quotes!
        I give you the quote, you give me movie it came from.
        The quote: <break time="1s"/>  ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt handle the truth!‚Äù
        Which movie is this?
        A League of Their Own
        The Sixth Sense
        or
        A Few Good Men?
    - getInput:
  next:
    first_question_answer: Check First Question
```
2. Then move on and add **first_question_answer** in the intents.yml file:

```yaml
first_question_answer:
  - '{first_question_answer_movie}'
  - 'The name of the movie was {first_question_answer_movie}'
```

3. Finish the step with editing the slots.yml and putting the **first_question_answer_movie** in - that would be your answers

```yaml
first_question_answer_movie:
  - a league of their own
  - the sixth sense
  - a few good men
```

4. To check if the answer was correct edit the **Check First Question** step in the main.yml file:

```yaml
- name: Check First Question
  actions:
    - compareContext:
        var: '{{ first_question_answer_movie | lower }}'
        is_equal: 'a few good men'
  next:
    'true': First Question Correct
    'false': First Question Incorrect
```

And just keep building your amazing game from here!
