# The script idea comes from BotTalk Facebook community:
#
# Hi all. Iâ€™m looking at using the trivia-game template on Github for a Skill I am hoping to develop.
# Nonetheless, in order to attract users to come back, I would like to vary the questions.
# So, my plan is to populate it with 50+ questions and then when the user reaches 5 correct answers,
# the Skill will finish. In order to vary this for users, I would like to pick the questions at random.
